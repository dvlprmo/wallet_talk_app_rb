# Post & Read Wallet

PR Wallet is an idea where it came from my struggling of reading articles. I read articles in daily routine, and sometime I read twice daily. I was using my iPhone and my iPad notes to add the links of articles to them, so I don't lose them. Recently, I have struggled in finding one links out of many and many articles in my notes, so I decided to leave those notes and move to make threads in Twitter. I start making a thread where I tweet my links under that thread, but I noticed it is going to be a mess when it get bigger and bigger with thousands of tweets. I decided to create a wallet with designed system and database so I can use it for only one purpose that is storing my articles in future purposes.
